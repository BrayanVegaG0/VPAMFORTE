  Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `SurveySubmission`, but
  registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `SurveySubmission`.
  
  To fix, do:
  
  ```
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(/* create a dummy instance of `SurveySubmission` */);
    });
  }
  ```
  
  This instance of `SurveySubmission` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.
  Therefore, if `SurveySubmission` is a function, it does not have to return a valid object and
  could throw unconditionally.
  If you cannot easily create an instance of `SurveySubmission`, consider defining a `Fake`:
  
  ```
  class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}
  
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
    });
  }
  ```
  
  Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `SurveySubmission` to prevent
  TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
  providing a convenient syntax.
